Prerequisites for Setting Up EFK Stack on AWS EKS
Before you begin setting up the EFK stack on your AWS EKS cluster, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. AWS Account
Youâ€™ll need an active AWS account to provision resources like EKS clusters, VPCs, and IAM roles. If you don't have an AWS account, create one here.

2. IAM Permissions
Ensure that you have the necessary IAM permissions to create and manage AWS resources, such as EKS, EC2 instances, VPCs, IAM roles, and security groups. The following IAM permissions will be required for the user:
eks:CreateCluster
eks:DescribeCluster
ec2:DescribeSubnets
ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups
iam:CreateRole
iam:AttachRolePolicy
iam:PassRole
You can assign an AdministratorAccess policy or create a custom policy with the required permissions.

3. Terraform
Terraform is used to provision infrastructure as code (IaC) for your EKS cluster and other AWS resources.
Install Terraform on your local machine. You can follow the official guide for installation: Install Terraform.
Make sure your AWS credentials are configured for Terraform (via AWS CLI or aws configure).

4. kubectl
kubectl is the Kubernetes command-line tool used to interact with your EKS cluster.
Install kubectl on your local machine. Follow the instructions here: Install kubectl.
Once installed, configure kubectl to interact with your EKS cluster using the following command:

aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name>

5. Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment of applications on Kubernetes clusters. You will use Helm to install the EFK stack.
Install Helm on your local machine by following the instructions here: Install Helm.
After installing Helm, ensure that it is configured correctly by running:

helm version

6. Git
You will need Git to clone your GitHub repository containing the setup scripts.
Install Git on your machine by following the instructions here: Install Git.
7. GitHub Repository Access
Your GitHub repository Observability-Stack contains the Terraform configuration files and Kubernetes manifests required to set up the EKS cluster and deploy the EFK stack. Make sure you have access to it.
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/CloudOps2029/Observability-Stack.git
cd Observability-Stack

8. AWS CLI
The AWS CLI is needed to interact with AWS services from the command line. It should be configured with your AWS credentials.
Install AWS CLI by following the guide: Install AWS CLI.
Once installed, configure it using:

aws configure

Optional Tools:
9. AWS CloudFormation (Optional)
You may use AWS CloudFormation to manage your infrastructure, but Terraform is the recommended tool for this setup.

10. Fluentd Configurations
If you want to further customize Fluentd, you should be familiar with its configuration. This may involve adding log parsing or filters to forward logs from your application to Elasticsearch.
Once all the prerequisites are set up, you can move on to provisioning the infrastructure, deploying the stack, and monitoring your application logs using the EFK stack!
